# cover_letter_template_tool

A simple Python tool to efficienty generate cover letter variants for roles I care about. The goal is to spend more time customizing (edits AFTER the basics go in) instead of copy/pasting into 50 different files.
Instead the script will copy/paste into 50 different files...but that's neither here nor there.

<!-- This tool helped me apply for a few roles I care about. If you're reading this because I applied to yours - hi. :) -->
